## Faker.js corpo takeover (a call for decentralized services) 

This week, if you tried to install [Faker.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/faker) (a very popular library for creating mocks) you've noticed the version was set on "6.6.6" and all code was gone with the text "What really happened with Aaron Swartz?". 

Was this a hack? what happened? And now what will be with all the users to the libraries which rely on this library?

Well, if you do a little google you would discover Marak himself decided to delete his code himself ([reasons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6S-b_k-ZKY)), but apparently, Github / Microsoft didn't approve this. [They chose to suspend Marak's account and revert the code.](https://twitter.com/marak/status/1479200803948830724)

This thing raises the question, do we really own our code? Should we let centralized services which are mostly owned by corporates dictate our content, communication and lives? 

This reminds me of the story of Cyberpunk 2084: in 2084, corporations were stronger than countries and technically have ruled over the world, [and one of the protagonists deeply hated this notion and tried to fight one of them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiOw2VFd1wI). 

I, in an ideal world, would like my content to stay mine, privacy controlled, and would like services to be:  
1. Decentralized,  
2. Be able to talk between them with an open-source protocol. 
This way, corporations' control in our life is more limited, freedom, communication, and free of speech is kept.  

nowadays, the Internet is only partly like this.

### In terms of communication:  
In the past, we had IRC's which each one can host his own chatting server, or [XMPP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkwXtWtVj3w) which was implemented by all the popular chats software: ICQ, Skype, MSN Messenger and etc.. so you [could even talk between applications](https://www.pidgin.im/). 
But nowadays we have closed-source Whatsapp, controlling most of the communication, with Singal and Telegram as bold alternatives but they are too, centralized. If they're gone we are doomed, and they can control and censor our communications. 

### In terms of media consumption:
We have youtube,
But did you know you can host your own [peertube](https://joinpeertube.org/) server? 

### In terms of code: 
- I gave Github and npm as an example of centralized services. 
Fortunately, you can create your own git and npm server :)

# What's your pain? IDK

1. Find a spouse. It's flawed. 

2. <u>Feel good at workplace:</u>  
- Is there a better and sincerer way to measure employee happiness.  
- Organization easily can be toxic and hard to keep wlb. How can we know it will keep it. 
Maybe a module knowing employees are working too hard or having a burnout (for example using GitHub API to check that).

3. It's hard to find a date when want to meet with friends. A micro-service can be created to poll just that. "Planny".

4. What else gives you pain: 
- Too much garbage to read at google, no real filtering of quality content. 
- I can stay locked instead of continuing my day. Too many seducers. 

5. Hard to find good friends to make a startup together. Can make a waitlist just like that? 
    - Idea is also hard to find. 
    - A social media for startups.  
    find your partner type.

## A few updates
1. I started a weekly guild at my job where I tell what's the news and talk about interesting subjects. 
2. I feel like I don't have a seperation between job and personal life. This week I worked myself to exhaustion at hours-not-hours, and then I got this allergy and burnout together. I just need to accustom myself to just stop working at a reasonable hour, and not let my mind drift. It's either I like the challenge so I want to think about it and to resolve it or I got a close deadline. It's damaging me in general. 

I know it's also the culture that effecting me, I hope it will get better in the future with less development and more research, rn it mostly feels development. 
3. It's really hard to start a personal project and to keep working on it. The mood app has not advanced, and I understood I don't like flutter (all this OOP mess, damn, gimmie js any day to this).

## Unworthy Javascript Monkey?

Nowadays javascript is everywhere and you can do with it almost anything you like, be it front, back or just literally scripting. It's also much more easier to leverage than other scripting languages: it has an expressive syntax and easy to use package manager (fighting with python deps and venv...).  

But sometimes, because of it's simplicity, I see everyone in the internet doing it, suddenly, I am not special at all and there is a lot of shitty reading material across the internet regarding web technologies that a bystander may think it's so easy and just look down on us frontend devs.

This, can made me feel lesser.  
Maybe, I should be a Rustacean, know something more complex and less popular, so I can feel special again ;).
